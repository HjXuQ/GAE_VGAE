# GAE-and-VGAE
This is a code file containing the autoencoders such AE, VAE, GAE, VGAE.

I must emphasize that the latent representations learned by the  VAE or VGAE can't directly be used for tasks, 
e.g, clustering, and classification.

Even though many bloggers think that VAE and VGAE can be used to learn the latent representations that retain the samples information in low-dimension space, but I think the purpose of the two is to generate new samples, not to reduce data dimension.
