0、This is my reproduced AutoEncoder and variational AutoEncoder by the Pytorch. If you find any errors or questions, please tell me.

1、Task: Unsupervised dimensionality reduction for clustering， classification， and Visualization

2、 
Clustering： k-means; 
Classification: SVM; 
Visualization: t-SNE;

3、Requirement: Ptthon 3.7, Pytorch: 1.5 and other pakeages which is illustrated in the code. And the codes can be runned in the windows.

4、This is a code file containing the AutoEncoder（AE） and variational AutoEncoder（VAE）. 
The purpose of this case is mainly to learn the latent representation. 
There are four datasets in this example，i.e., ATT, COIL, UMIST，and Yale. 
If you want to use other datasets, you just need to put your dataset in the "Dataset" folder. 

5、If you think my code is helpful to you, please light me a star, thank you.
