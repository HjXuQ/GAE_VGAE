# GAE-and-VGAE
Task: graph embedding for clustering and classification

Requirement: Ptthon 3.7, Pytorch: 1.5 and other pakeages which is illustrated in the code.
And the codes can be runned in the windows.


This is a code file containing the graph autoencoders (GAE) and variational graph autoencoder （VAE).
The purpose of this case is mainly to learn the latent representation, etc, the graph embedding.
There are two datasets in this example，i.e., Cora and Yale.
Cora is a graph dataset and ATT is a no-graph dataset.
The adjacency matrix for the ATT is calculated by the KNN (k=9).
